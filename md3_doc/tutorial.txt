BLENDER AND PLUGIN INSTALLATION! MUST BE THESE VERSIONS OR IT WILL NOT WORK

1. Get Blender 2.62 32bit for windows.
2. copy the io_export_md3.py script into the addon folder YOU MUST USE THIS FILE, NO OTHER FILE

EXPORTING MD3 FROM BLENDER

Buildings:

1. The object you wish to export must be renamed to be "l_legs"
2. Create two new objects, with one polygon each, place them somewhere hidden, call them "u_torso" and "h_head"
3. Create two empty objects, without any polygons, call them "tag_head" and "tag_torso"
4. You must UV map all objects, "l_legs", "u_torso" and "h_head"
5. Do any animation you want
6. Select "l_legs", "tag_torso" and export MD3. Set Scale as 0.5 and set name as buildingX, where X is the building number. Name the file
buildingX_lower.md3 (example building1_lower.md3, building2_lower.md3)
7. Select "u_torso", "tag_torso", "tag_head" and export. Set scale as 0.5 and name it buildingX with filename buildingX_upper.md3
8. Select "h_head", "tag_head" and export. Set scale as 0.5 and name it buildingX with filename buildingX_head.md3

9. Create a .skin file for each md3 file, example building1_lower.skin
in _lower.skin:
tag_torso,
l_legs,buildingX/texturefilename.bmp

_upper.skin:
tag_head,
tag_torso,
u_torso,buildingX/texturefilename.bmp
u_head,buildingX/texturefilename.bmp

_head.skin:
tag_head,
h_head,buildingX/texturefilename.bmp

10. create an animation file called buildingX_animation.cfg: (this will probably have to change for buildings)
